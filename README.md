# Code Experiment

:seedling: **This experiment is not ready yet! Come back later.**

This project is for STAT-441 Exprimental Design at
Montana State University - Bozeman during Spring 2019
as part of my PhD program.

## Preparing Experiment

1. Compile all sort algorithms for all the languages.
   - If you do not wish to run all of the tests then modify [`main.go`](./main.go) to indicate which tests are being run.
2. Use the following command to collect experimental data: `go run main.go`
3. Results are collected in `result.txt`
